## CE 471: Capstone 1 {#sec-capstone1}
::: {.callout-note}
## Proposed Change
Develop CE 471 into a 3-credit hour course that counts as an Advanced Written and Oral Communication GE. Eliminates WRTG 316 (3)
:::

Students currently take WRTG 316 Technical Writing to fulfil the [Advanced Written and Oral Communication AWOC](https://ge.byu.edu/00000173-e9b7-dc88-a5fb-fdff6ad60000/advanced-written-and-oral-communication) University Core requirement. While the instructors are well trained in writing pedagogy, they are not engineers, they are not consistent each semester, and they are trying to meet the needs of diverse academic departments. Student feedback over the years suggests that while some aspects of the course are valuable (such as writing methods), the instructors and learning activities do not relate well to their own disciplines, defeating many of the AWOC learning outcomes. 
 
We propose to bring AWOC into the CE program as part of the Capstone experience. The first Capstone semester would increase to 3 credits to accommodate the change. The AWOC learning activities would be specific to Capstone projects or senior thesis (see @sec-thesis): proposal writing, oral presentations, literature reviews, resume preparation, interview skills, peer reviews, and so on. BYU’s Advanced Writing Center will support the writing pedagogy portions of the course which our faculty are not well trained to do; our own faculty will handle the technical portions. This teaching balance will better meet the intent of the AWOC requirement. 

## CE 472: Capstone 2 {#sec-capstone2}

## CE 499R: Senior Thesis {#sec-thesis}
::: {.callout-note}
## Proposed Change
Allow students completing senior theses (honors theses or mentored research
projects with substantive deliverables) to count their work as a culminating
design experience.
:::

ABET requires a “culminating major engineering design experience” incorporating
“engineering standards and multiple constraints” and based on “earlier
coursework.” We have satisfied this requirement with Capstone in the past, but
alternative projects such as honors theses and mentored research may also
qualify. Past students who completed both Capstone and an alternative experience
expressed that their alternative experience was more meaningful.  
 
At BYU, where undergraduate research is so highly valued, we ought to offer it
as a pathway to fulfilling this requirement. A senior thesis option can run
parallel to Capstone 2. Logistically, we would establish a 3-credit CE 499R
Senior Project course for such students. Early in the Capstone 1 course, a
senior thesis student would seek approval from the undergraduate coordinator,
demonstrating that they have a mentor and an appropriate project that can be
publication-ready by the end of the second semester. Throughout the second
semester (CE 499R), the student would develop the project and prepare the final
deliverables. The student’s work would be evaluated by a three-member committee
consisting of the undergraduate coordinator (or honors coordinator for honors students),
the mentor, and one other faculty member.
