    "text": "Motivation\nBuilt environments that are well designed, constructed, and maintained improve the quality of life for God’s children on His earth. These built environments face threats and challenges that change rapidly: natural hazards, climate change, population growth, and global economic and political conditions all at times threaten human happiness and well-being. The mission of the Civil Engineering program at Brigham Young University should be to develop students of faith, intellect, and character who are capable of meeting and solving challenges to built environments now and in the future.\nBYU’s civil engineering program has historically succeeded in generating high-quality, well-trained graduates. But as the field of civil engineering changes, the skills students need to address these challenges change as well. Further, graduating seniors have regularly commented on the inflexibility and inefficiency of our current program. This document describes a proposal for several changes to the requirements for a Bachelor of Science degree in Civil Engineering that we hope will better prepare our students with broad and highly flexible degree program.\nIn creating this proposal, the Undergraduate Curriculum Committee was deeply impressed by these two paragraphs from the Undergraduate – Depth section of Aims of a BYU Education:\n\nDepth does not result merely from taking many courses in a field. Indeed, excessive course coverage requirements may discourage rather than enhance depth. Depth comes when students realize “the effect of rigorous, coherent, and progressively more sophisticated study.” Depth helps students distinguish between what is fundamental and what is only peripheral; it requires focus, provides intense concentration, and encourages a “lean and taut” degree that has a “meaningful core” and a purposefully designed structure (Memorandum to the Faculty No. 13). In addition to describing carefully structured academic majors, this description applies to well-designed BYU courses of all kinds.\n\n\nThe chief result of depth is competence. BYU’s students should be “capable of competing with the best students in their field” (Mission Statement). Even so, undergraduate study should be targeted at entrance-level, not expert-level, abilities. The desire for depth should not lead to bachelor’s degrees that try to teach students everything they will need to know after graduation. Students should be able to complete their degrees within about four years.\n\nThe specific proposals we include in the remainder of this document are made with the intent to\n\nIncrease personal agency and personal investment for students in the program by offering meaningful course options at several places.\nIntroduce students to discipline areas earlier in the program.\nAllow students to complete either a broad civil engineering degree or develop targeted skills based on their interests and desires.\nDecrease the number of credit hours required for a degree to approximately 120 credit hours.\nDevelop a framework that allows for new discipline area courses (e.g., data science, construction engineering) to seamlessly enter the program in response to changing industry needs.\n\nA flowchart with the proposed changes is given in Figure 1. This proposal reduces the required credit hours to 122 from 128. The remainder of this document presents the changes by class year, along with a set of informal learning outcomes for each year. Chapter 5 presents a series of “student stories” describing how a variety of students might approach a civil engineering degree in the new program, complete with individual flowcharts.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Proposed program flowchart (right-click to open larger in new tab)."

We desire to make this a class that shows how designing and building civil infrastructure benefits society through interactive case studies and a lens of stewardship. Proposed learning outcomes include:\n\nDescribe how civil infrastructure and the built environment can foster (or inhibit) a sustainable society, including efforts to achieve United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\nApply the principle of time value of money to identify financially sustainable infrastructure investment decisions.\nRecognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts. (ABET Student Outcome 4)\nFunction effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives. (ABET Student Outcome 5)\n\nWe intend that this course will qualify for the Global and Cultural Awareness University Core requirement (focused on the global challenge of sustainability), or as an Explorations: Science and Technology in the proposed GE. We also expect this change to enhance recruiting of undecided majors across campus and begin generating interest in civil engineering and construction disciplines students will explore later."

Eliminate CCE 112 (3 credit hours) and CCE 214 (2 credit hours)\n\n\nThe list of practical skills that engineering students need is always expanding, with new software replacing formerly essential tools (e.g. the shift from manual drafting to CAD) or creating new ones (GIS). Rather than adding and shifting course requirements as tools become available – and retaining legacy classes that have been superseded – we propose a two-course series where individual sections focus on different software and measurement techniques.\nCCE 117 is proposed as a two-credit hour software class. We anticipate a section focused on GIS and another on CAD, but others may be possible. Specific learning outcomes will vary by software, but all sections will require that students will:\n\nUnderstand and explain software licensing models and how to install software.\nDownload technical files from web-based repositories, store the files onto local and shared computing networks, and open files in commercial engineering software.\nObtain useful guidance from software documentation and online help forums, including generative AI as appropriate.\nProduce a visualization supporting an engineering design or analysis.\n\nCCE 118 is proposed as a one-credit hour engineering measurements class. We anticipate potential sections on surveying, remote sensing, water quality measurements, and piezoelectric sensors. The proposed learning outcomes for all sections are that students will:\n\nDescribe the purpose of data collection in engineering projects.\nDescribe the challenge of measurement accuracy and tolerance.\nUse modern techniques to record, store, and disseminate engineering data.\nConstruct basic visualizations of engineering data.\n\nWe recognize that many construction management students are likely to derive more benefit from BIM than GIS. If the construction management program elects to retain its three-credit hour CCE 113 BIM class, we would allow CE students to take that class as a substitute for CCE 117."

As a result, many engineering programs across the country require a fluid mechanics course prior to proceeding with discipline-specific classes. Moving fluid mechanics to a required sophomore-level class (1) naturally fills the void left by removing dynamics from our curriculum, (2) demonstrates to students that modeling of physical behavior is not limited to structural phenomena (3) better prepares students to take junior-level courses, and (4) enables students to explore topics in water engineering and soils engineering earlier in their program of study. Learning outcomes for this class will largely remain consistent with those of CE 332, which are\n\nSetup, perform, evaluate, and report on elementary hydraulic experiments;\nUse basic calculations to describe static pressures and forces in fluids;\nUnderstand and apply conservation of mass, momentum, and energy in flow analysis problems;\nApply concepts of drag and lift to solve introductory problems of forces and dynamics;\nEmploy and evaluate between standard methods to analyze and design pressure pipe systems;\nUnderstand basic elements of pump and turbine flow to analyze and select appropriate fluid pumps for basic pumping situations.\n\nIt is also anticipated that this change will breathe additional hope into students that currently may feel bogged down by two full years of solid mechanics prior to getting into alternative subject areas. This change is intended to improve retention for these students."

Here, students will be asked to use computers and computation to solve discipline-specific problems. The intent of this class is to help students gain necessary computing skills while seeing they can solve interesting problems in a variety of discipline areas using computing. Based on this experience, students will be better prepared to select junior-level courses that best meet their interests. Learning outcomes for the class include\n\nApproach problems in mulitple civil engineering discipline areas from a programmatic mindset\nApply intermediate spreadsheet skills to solve civil engineering problems in a variety of disciplines\nCreate custom code in a modern programming language to automate redundant or otherwise intractable engineering processes\nCollaborate with a team to develop and present software of value to stakeholders\n\nRecall that CCE 170 was originally taught as a sophomore-level class, but was moved to a freshman-level class to accommodate basic training in Excel necessary for some 200-level classes. Many of these prerequisite and basic skills in Excel will now be covered briefly in CCE 101."

    "section": "3.1 CE Breadth Core",
    "text": "3.1 CE Breadth Core\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProposed Change\n\n\n\nRequire students to complete four of six discipline area classes, instead of all six courses.\n\n\nCivil engineers must be trained to solve problems in multiple discipline areas. The ABET criteria for civil engineering programs states:\n\nThe curriculum must prepare graduates to analyze and solve problems in at least four technical areas appropriate to civil engineering\n\nThe ASCE commentary (p. 11) on this criterion in part states:\n\nIn response to emerging societal needs, civil engineering programs may need to develop non-standard technical areas. These breadth areas should be supported by constituent and stakeholder feedback, and connected to the Program Educational Objectives.\n\nIn our program, we have historically met this requirement with introductory discpline area classes at the 300-level. The requirement to take all courses is unnecessarily constraining to both the students and our program, however.\nFirst, students who investigate the civil engineering major because it houses a discipline they have interest in are often deterred by the abundance of seemingly irrelevant courses. For example, a student interested in urban transport or environmental mitigation might see two or three courses of relevance but several required courses in which they have little interest and elect to study Plant and Wildlife Science or Geography instead.\nSecond, as new discipline classes are proposed (e.g., construction engineering, engineering data science, etc.), they require us to reconsider anew where they will fit into our program. This proposed changes sets the stage for sustainable flexibility in our core offerings as the disciplines of civil engineering evolve.\nWe anticipate some growing pains and objections to this proposal. These objections are reasonable, but we hope we can address them in the following ways\n\nHow will students know that they don’t want to do \\(X\\) if they have never had a class in \\(X\\)? We intend for the proposed changes to CCE 101 (Section 1.1) will help students first see the purpose of each discipline in improving the quality of life for God’s children on His earth, and that improvements to CCE 270 (Section 2.2) will give meaningful exposure to questions and methods in all discipline areas, before students choose which junior core classes to pursue.\nWon’t students just take the courses that are easiest / the courses that their friends are taking? This is a real possibility, but we believe that students must be accountable for their own intellectual development. We believe that the quality of course instruction will improve when the participating students have invested their agency in selecting courses.\nCan you call yourself a civil engineer if you haven’t had a class in \\(X\\)? BYU would be far from the first university to not require specific discipline area classes in a civil engineering degree. At least Georgia Tech, Texas A&M, and UC Davis have degree programs without specific discipline area course requirements.\nWill this have any ABET ramifications? For civil engineering breadth, we are in good shape by requiring four discipline area classes. There is an additional requirement that students “conduct experiments in at least two discipline areas.” To ensure that this requirement is met for all students, we will need to ask that at least four 300 level classes include an “experiment.”\nWill our students still pass the FE? It is possible that depending on the courses students select and the specific makeup of their exams, students may encounter more or fewer problems that they are directly trained to solve. We anticipate that the FE review course will still be valuable.\nWon’t many of our students just want a well-rounded, all areas civil engineering degree? The hope is that this proposal will allow students to choose for themselves what they would like to achieve in their education. Any 300-level courses beyond the four course breadth requirement would count as CCE technical electives, thus a student who wanted to take all discipline area classes for additional FE preparation could still do so. (see the student story in Figure 5.2)."

Eliminates WRTG 316 (3)\n\n\nStudents currently take WRTG 316 Technical Writing to fulfil the Advanced Written and Oral Communication AWOC University Core requirement. While the instructors are well trained in writing pedagogy, they are not engineers, they are not consistent each semester, and they are trying to meet the needs of diverse academic departments. Student feedback over the years suggests that while some aspects of the course are valuable (such as writing methods), the instructors and learning activities do not relate well to their own disciplines, defeating many of the AWOC learning outcomes.\nWe propose to bring AWOC into the CE program as part of the Capstone experience. This is something that many programs on campus have done, with the aid and encouragement of the English department, and there is an application process already in place. The first Capstone semester would increase to 3 credits to accommodate the change. The AWOC learning activities would be specific to Capstone projects or senior thesis (see Section 4.2): proposal writing, oral presentations, literature reviews, resume preparation, interview skills, peer reviews, and so on. We recommend hiring an adjunct instructor with a technical writing background and an English degree to teach the writing portions of the course and aid the the capstone director. The capstone director will also have to participate in some English department training activities."

Past students who completed both Capstone and an alternative experience expressed that their alternative experience was more meaningful.\nAt BYU, where undergraduate research is so highly valued, we ought to offer it as a pathway to fulfilling this requirement. A senior thesis option can run parallel to Capstone 2. Logistically, we would establish a 3-credit CE 499R Senior Project course for such students (there is already a HONRS 499R). Early in the Capstone 1 course, a senior thesis student would petition the undergraduate coordinator. demonstrating that they have a mentor and an appropriate project that can be publication-ready by the end of the second semester. Upon approval, this student would be excused from a capstone project group. Throughout the second semester, the student would develop the project and prepare the final deliverables. The student’s work will be evaluated by a three-member committee consisting of the undergraduate coordinator (or honors coordinator for honors students), the mentor, and one other faculty member to ensure that it is appropriate as a culminating design experience."
