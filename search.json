    "text": "Motivation\nBuilt environments that are well designed, constructed, and maintained improve the quality of life for God’s children on His earth. These built environments face threats and challenges that change rapidly: natural hazards, climate change, population growth, and global economic and political conditions all at times threaten human happiness and well-being. The mission of the Civil Engineering program at Brigham Young University should be to develop students of faith, intellect, and character who are capable of meeting and solving these challenges now and in the future.\nBYU’s civil engineering program has historically succeeded in generating high-quality, well-trained graduates. But as the field of civil engineering changes, the skills students need to address these challenges change as well. Further, graduating seniors have regularly commented on the inflexibility and inefficiency of our current program. This document describes a proposal for several changes to the requirements for a Bachelor of Science degree in Civil Engineering that we hope will better prepare our students with broad and highly flexible degree program.\nIn creating this proposal, the Undergraduate Curriculum Committee was deeply impressed by these two paragraphs from the Undergraduate – Depth section of Aims of a BYU Education:\n\nDepth does not result merely from taking many courses in a field. Indeed, excessive course coverage requirements may discourage rather than enhance depth. Depth comes when students realize “the effect of rigorous, coherent, and progressively more sophisticated study.” Depth helps students distinguish between what is fundamental and what is only peripheral; it requires focus, provides intense concentration, and encourages a “lean and taut” degree that has a “meaningful core” and a purposefully designed structure (Memorandum to the Faculty No. 13). In addition to describing carefully structured academic majors, this description applies to well-designed BYU courses of all kinds.\n\n\nThe chief result of depth is competence. BYU’s students should be “capable of competing with the best students in their field” (Mission Statement). Even so, undergraduate study should be targeted at entrance-level, not expert-level, abilities. The desire for depth should not lead to bachelor’s degrees that try to teach students everything they will need to know after graduation. Students should be able to complete their degrees within about four years.\n\nThe specific proposals we include in the remainder of this document are made with the intent to\n\nIncrease personal agency and personal investment for students in the program by offering meaningful course options at several places.\nDecrease the number of credit hours required for a degree to approximately 120 credit hours.\nDevelop a framework that allows for new discipline area courses (e.g., data science, construction engineering) to seamlessly enter the program in response to changing industry needs.\n\nA flowchart with the proposed changes is given in Figure 1. This proposal reduces the required credit hours to 122 from 128. The remainder of this document presents the changes by class year, along with a set of informal learning outcomes for each year. Chapter 5 presents a series of “student stories” describing how a variety of students might approach a civil engineering degree in the new program.\n\n\nUnable to display PDF file.

We desire to make this a class that shows how designing and building civil infrastructure benefits society through interactive case studies and a lens of sustainability. Proposed learning outcomes include:\n\nDescribe how civil infrastructure and the built environment can foster (or inhibit) a sustainable society, including efforts to achieve United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\nApply the principle of time value of money to identify financially sustainable infrastructure investment decisions.\nRecognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts. (ABET Student Outcome 4)\nFunction effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives. (ABET Student Outcome 5)\n\nWe intend that this course will qualify for the Global and Cultural Awareness University Core requirement, or as an Explorations: Science and Technology in the proposed GE."

    "text": "1.2 CCE 117 / 118 Engineering Software and Measurements\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProposed Change\n\n\n\nProposed Change: Create a set of new courses introducing students to engineering software and measurements. Eliminate CCE 112 (3 credit hours) and CCE 214 (2 credit hours)\n\n\nThe list of practical skills that engineering students need is always expanding, with new software replacing formerly essential tools (the shift from manual drafting to CAD) or creating new ones (GIS). Rather than adding and shifting course requirements as tools become available – and retaining legacy classes that have been superseded – we propose a two-course series where individual sections focus on different software and measurement techniques.\nCCE 117 is proposed as a two-credit hour software class. We anticipate a section focused on GIS and another on CAD, but others may be possible. Specific learning outcomes will vary by software, but all sections will require that students will:\n\nUnderstand and explain software licensing models and how to install software.\nDownload technical files from web-based repositories, store the files onto local and shared computing networks, and open files in commercial engineering software.\nObtain useful guidance from software documentation and online help forums, including generative AI as appropriate.\nProduce a visualization supporting an engineering design or analysis.\n\nCCE 118 is proposed as a one-credit hour engineering measurements class. We anticipate potential sections on surveying, remote sensing, water quality measurements, and piezoelectric sensors. The proposed learning outcomes for all sections are that students will:\n\nDescribe the purpose of data collection in engineering projects.\nDescribe the challenge of measurement accuracy and tolerance.\nUse modern techniques to record, store, and disseminate engineering data.\nConstruct basic visualizations of engineering data.\n\nWe recognize that many construction management students are likely to derive more benefit from BIM than GIS. If the construction management program elects to retain its three-credit hour CCE 113 BIM class, we would allow CE students to take that class as a substitute for CCE 117."

But the University Core requires a course in life sciences, which we represent on the present flowchart with Biology 100. We propose to use this course as the “one additional area of basic science” required by ABET, thus allowing students to take a second course in Physics or Chemistry later in the program. Courses that could be used to fill this requirement include:\n\nBIO 100 - Principles of Biology\nCELL 120 - Science of Biology\nHONRS 220 - Unexpect Connect: Biol-Letters\nMMBIO 121 - Gen Biology: Health & Disease\nMMBIO 221 - General Microbiology\nPWS 150 - Environmental Biology"

Eliminates WRTG 316 (3)\n\n\nStudents currently take WRTG 316 Technical Writing to fulfil the Advanced Written and Oral Communication AWOC University Core requirement. While the instructors are well trained in writing pedagogy, they are not engineers, they are not consistent each semester, and they are trying to meet the needs of diverse academic departments. Student feedback over the years suggests that while some aspects of the course are valuable (such as writing methods), the instructors and learning activities do not relate well to their own disciplines, defeating many of the AWOC learning outcomes.\nWe propose to bring AWOC into the CE program as part of the Capstone experience. The first Capstone semester would increase to 3 credits to accommodate the change. The AWOC learning activities would be specific to Capstone projects or senior thesis (see Section 4.3): proposal writing, oral presentations, literature reviews, resume preparation, interview skills, peer reviews, and so on. BYU’s Advanced Writing Center will support the writing pedagogy portions of the course which our faculty are not well trained to do; our own faculty will handle the technical portions. This teaching balance will better meet the intent of the AWOC requirement."

Past students who completed both Capstone and an alternative experience expressed that their alternative experience was more meaningful.\nAt BYU, where undergraduate research is so highly valued, we ought to offer it as a pathway to fulfilling this requirement. A senior thesis option can run parallel to Capstone 2. Logistically, we would establish a 3-credit CE 499R Senior Project course for such students. Early in the Capstone 1 course, a senior thesis student would seek approval from the undergraduate coordinator, demonstrating that they have a mentor and an appropriate project that can be publication-ready by the end of the second semester. Throughout the second semester (CE 499R), the student would develop the project and prepare the final deliverables. The student’s work would be evaluated by a three-member committee consisting of the undergraduate coordinator (or honors coordinator for honors students), the mentor, and one other faculty member."

She’s not sure about grad school, but could be persuaded.\nFreshman Year When arriving at BYU Sarah was mostly focused on GE’s while looking for a major. One day on the BYU website she sees a profile of Jim Nelson’s research, and decides she wants to learn how to do environmental hydrology. She has already taken the PWS Environmental Biology class as well as Chem 105, so she enrolls in CCE 101 for Winter semester. In March she receives a call to serve a Chinese speaking mission in Canada, and is gone for 18 months.\nSophomore Year When Sarah returns from her mission, she wants to continue studying Chinese, so she makes room in her schedule for Chinese 301 and 302 by putting off the Math classes for a semester she can fit them in.\nJunior Year Sarah elects to skip structural analysis and transportation engineering so that she can attain a deeper focus on environmental hydrology. She still has breadth classes in soil mechanics and engineering materials, which will prepare her for design electives next year. She decides to take English Civ instead of the Music series she started as a Freshman so it will double-count for her Letters GE requirement, while adding an Arts GE elective in Asian art.\nSenior Year While taking the design classes in GIS software and hydraulics, Sarah is recruited for a senior research project and associated study abroad. She builds hydrologic hazards mapping software for communities in Nepal as a culminating design experience.\n\n\nUnable to display PDF file.

He also notices that because he doesn’t plan to take CE 351: Environmental, he can put off CHEM 105 and instead take his fluids and computations class a semester earlier. This gives him a head start on Materials and Soils, preparing him for an internship with a geotechnical engineering firm with UDOT contracts.\nJunior Year John has a girlfriend who served her mission in Paris, and they decide to take the French and Italian cinema class together to fill his arts GE elective. For his life science and social science GE electives, John decides that Environmental Biology might fill in some things he missed by not taking CE 351, and the disasters class in the geography department could provide useful background for a highway engineer who is worried about resiliency. And because he is a little bit ahead in the program, John gets started on his design electives, opting to take CE 461 in his junior year. He also decides to take CE 331 Hydrology as a tech elective, even though he already has fulfilled the breadth requirement for the program.\nSenior Year Hearing more about all the things a UDOT rotational engineer works on, John fills out his four remaining CE electives with an eclectic mix of traffic engineering, hydraulic engineering, and reinforced bridge design. And after putting off his GE Civ classes, John realizes that he kind of liked his literature teacher back in high school and decides to do a series in English and Comparative Literature, which double-counts as his GE Letters requirement. His team’s capstone project involves a drainage plan for a new pedestrian trail in Springville, and he’s glad he took the extra class in Hydrology the year before.\n\n\nUnable to display PDF file.

Emma also hopes that completing University Honors will help distinguish her application. The choices she makes for her curriculum include:\nFreshman Year For the engineering software class, Emma pairs BIM and a class in data collection with drones because it sounds cool. She also takes the first-year Honors classes.\nSophomore Year Emma selects Art History civilization classes because she hopes to learn about how humans have built spaces for themselves throughout history. The trips to the JFSB provide a welcome relief from Chemistry and Solid Mechanics, where she can stretch a different part of her brain.\nJunior Year To prepare herself for the structural design classes she is interested in, Emma takes Materials and Structural Analysis. She is also interested in the urban transportation planning course, so she takes Environmental Engineering and Transportation to fill out her CE Core, as well as the Energy, Climate, and the Environment class offered in the Physics department. Because she is in the Honors Program, Emma picks three Unexpected Connections classes that also fill her Life Science, Social Science, and Arts General Education requirements. She especially liked the class “Blessed are the Poor: Understanding Poverty through History and Theology” taught by faculty in Sociology and Religion.\nSenior Year Now prepared with substantive breadth in CE and other courses of her choosing, Emma digs into her senior year with a difficult set of technical electives and begins working with Dr. Judd on her honors thesis, looking at self-correcting floor mechanisms in steel frame buildings. She wishes she could go back in time and take the class in structural sensors for her CCE 118 option, but it’s not too much of a lift to figure out how to attach and calibrate the sensors and associated equipment during her summer research assistantship. She uses this effort as her culminating design experience, and the ability to focus on this complex design problem helps to generate a publication-quality research article.\n\n\nUnable to display PDF file.
