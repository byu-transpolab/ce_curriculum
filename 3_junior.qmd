# Junior Year
The learning outcomes for this year are for students to: 

  1. Obtain a broad exposure to multiple disciplines of civil engineering. 
  1. Prepare for technical and design electives, as well as a Capstone experience. 

## CE Breadth Core {#sec-breadth}
::: {.callout-note}
## Proposed Change
Require students to complete four of six discipline area classes, instead of all six courses.

## Social Science Elective
::: {.callout-note}
## Proposed Change
Allow students to select a course for the Social Science University Core that most interests them.

Eliminating CCE 231 will necessitate that our students take a course that meets
the social science requirements for the University Core. This also helps accomodate students who may have 
taken a GE class before entering the major. While any appropriate course could fill
this box, we might recommended a list to students including: 

  - [GEOG 110]()  Landscapes of Disaster 
  - [EXSC 221]() Science of Wellness 
  - [ANTHR 101]()  Social/Cultural Anthropology 
  - [ECON 110]()  Econ Principles & Problems 
  - [HONRS 226]() Unexpect Connect: Soc Sci-Ltrs 
  - [PSYCH 111]() Psychological Science 
  - [SOC 112]() Current Social Problems 


## Life Science Elective
::: {.callout-note}
## Proposed Change
Require students to select a life science University Core course from a list. 
:::
ABET requires classes in “calculus-based physics, college-level chemistry, and
one additional area of basic science.” Historically, this requirement has been
met with PHYSCS 121, CHEM 105, and GEOL 330. But the University Core requires a
course in life sciences, which we represent on the present flowchart with
Biology 100. We propose to use this course as the “one additional area of basic
science” required by ABET, thus allowing students to take a second course in
Physics or Chemistry later in the program. Courses that could be used to fill
this requirement include: 

  - [BIO 100]() - Principles of Biology 
  - [CELL 120]() - Science of Biology 
  - [HONRS 220]() - Unexpect Connect: Biol-Letters 
  - [MMBIO 121]() - Gen Biology: Health & Disease 
  - [MMBIO 221]() - General Microbiology 
  - [PWS 150]() - Environmental Biology 


## Advanced Science Elective
::: {.callout-note}
## Proposed Change
Require an advanced science class from a list; GEOL 330 is no longer required for all students.
