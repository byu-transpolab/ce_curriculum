# Sophomore Year {#sec-sophomore}

The learning outcomes for this year are for students to: 

  1. Apply advanced physics and mathematics to solve problems in solid and fluid mechanics. 
  2. Apply basic computational techniques – including writing functions, reading complex datasets, and optimization – to solve meaningful problems in all discipline areas of civil engineering. 
  3. Identify which discipline breadth classes to take in the junior year. 


## CE 232: Fluid Mechanics
::: {.callout-note}
## Proposed Change
Convert CE 332 from a 300-level discipline area class into a 200-level mechanics class required for all students. 
:::


## CCE 270: Engineering Computation {#sec-ce270}
::: {.callout-note}
## Proposed Change
Convert CCE 170 into a 200-level computation class with a higher level of computational tasks drawn from all discipline areas.

## Math Core

There is no proposed change here, other than we are electing to show the three-course math sequence on the flowchart,
giving it primacy over the two-course sequence. Both sequences will remain acceptable in the new program.
