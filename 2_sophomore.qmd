# Sophomore Year {#sec-sophomore}

The learning outcomes for this year are for students to: 

  1. Apply advanced physics and mathematics to solve problems in solid and fluid mechanics. 
  2. Apply basic computational techniques – including writing functions, reading complex datasets, and optimization – to solve meaningful problems in all discipline areas of civil engineering. 
  3. Identify which discipline breadth classes to take in the junior year. 


## CE 232: Fluid Mechanics
::: {.callout-note}
## Proposed Change
Convert CE 332 from a 300-level discipline area class into a 200-level mechanics class required for all students. 
:::
Fluid mechanics is an important prerequisite for many junior-level classes,
including geotechnical engineering and environmental engineering. As a result,
many engineering programs across the country require a fluid mechanics course
prior to proceeding with discipline-specific classes. Moving fluid mechanics to
a required sophomore-level class (1) naturally fills the void left by removing
dynamics from our curriculum, (2) demonstrates to students that modeling of
physical behavior is not limited to structural phenomena, (3) better prepares
students to take junior-level courses, and (4) enables students to explore
topics in water engineering and soils engineering earlier in their
program of study. Learning outcomes for this class will largely remain
consistent with those of CE 332, which are 

  - Setup, perform, evaluate, and report on elementary hydraulic experiments; 
  - Use basic calculations to describe static pressures and forces in fluids; 
  - Understand and apply conservation of mass, momentum, and energy in flow analysis problems; 
  - Apply concepts of drag and lift to solve introductory problems of forces and dynamics; 
  - Employ and evaluate between standard methods to analyze and design pressure pipe systems; 
  - Understand basic elements of pump and turbine flow to analyze and select appropriate fluid pumps for basic pumping situations. 

It is also anticipated that this change will breathe additional hope into
students that currently may feel bogged down by two full years of solid
mechanics prior to getting into alternative subject areas. This change is
intended to improve retention for these students. 

## CCE 270: Engineering Computation {#sec-ce270}
::: {.callout-note}
## Proposed Change
Convert CCE 170 into a 200-level computation class with a higher level of computational tasks drawn from all discipline areas.
:::

To better expose students to the various disciplines of civil engineering, as
well as to build on the momentum established in CCE 102 (see @sec-sustainability), CCE 170 will be
converted back into a sophomore-level class. Here, students will be asked to use
computers and computation to solve discipline-specific problems. The intent of
this class is to help students gain necessary computing skills while seeing they
can solve interesting problems in a variety of discipline areas using computing.
Based on this experience, students will be better prepared to select
junior-level courses that best meet their interests. Learning outcomes for the
class include 

  - Approach problems in mulitple civil engineering discipline areas from a
  programmatic mindset
  - Apply intermediate spreadsheet skills to solve civil engineering problems in a
  variety of disciplines
  - Create custom code in a modern programming language to automate redundant or
  otherwise intractable engineering processes 
  - Collaborate with a team to develop and present software of value to
  stakeholders 

Recall that CCE 170 was originally taught as a sophomore-level class, but was
moved to a freshman-level class to accommodate basic training in Excel necessary
for some 200-level classes. Many of these prerequisite and basic skills in Excel will
now be covered briefly in CCE 102, in the context of engineering economics. 

## Math Core

There is no proposed change here, other than we are electing to show the three-course math sequence on the flowchart,
giving it primacy over the two-course sequence. Both sequences will remain acceptable in the new program.
